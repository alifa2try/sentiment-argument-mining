## Argumentation Mining

* spontaneous vs. prepared speeches -> how to decipher one from another
* would be helpful to have this done on a speech level

* would need to build argument structure for entire speech and then correlate other speeches
* perhaps some kind of common-element extension to form complete graph
* build up graph structure for speeches and then check how adversarial they are
* this could be used to indicate spontaneous speeches
* first step could be to check if there are any spontaneous speeches at all, or perhaps spontaneous segments of speeches

* perhaps could build up from ontologies of existing atoms and meanings in political domains
