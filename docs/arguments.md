## Argumentation Mining

### Spontaneous vs. prepared speeches/segments

* Spontaneous vs. prepared speeches -> how to decipher one from another
* Would be helpful to have this done on a inter/intra-speech level

#### Possible techniques

* Build argument structure for entire speech and then correlate other speeches
* Perhaps some kind of common-element extension to form complete graph
* Build up graph structure for speeches and then check how adversarial they are
* First step could be to check if there are any spontaneous speeches at all, or perhaps spontaneous segments of speeches
* Perhaps could build up from ontologies of existing atoms and meanings in political domains

#### Frameworks

1. Use microtext corpora to create argumentation structure (https://github.com/peldszus/arg-microtexts & https://github.com/peldszus/arg-microtexts-multilayer)
    * This would utilize theoretical argumentation structures; work would have to put in to extrapolate structures from local to global ones

2. Use US election debate corpus to create claims/premises of speeches (https://github.com/ElecDeb60To16/Dataset)
